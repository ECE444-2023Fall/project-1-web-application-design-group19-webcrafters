# Contributing to the Repo

Welcome to the GitHub Repo for Betula. We would love to hear your feedback! 
Here are the rules to contribute to our repo: 

1. Develop on a separate branch for each user story.
2. When completed and you have code that is functioning as it should, make a pull request.
3. Once pull request is approved, then merge your branch into the main branch and delete the separate branch.
4. If code is not completed and you need help with debugging / need further clarification, create a Git Issue and explain your progress so far and the issue in detail.

## For Pull Requests 

Tag @AniqaT for pull request of backend feature and tag @jessicawong3 for pull request of frontend feature. 

## For Git Issues 

1. Include a detailed description of your progress so far, what is going wrong and the suspected cause. 
2. Link your branch with the Git Issue. 
3. Assign the issue to yourself and at least 1 other developer who can assist you.
4. Once the issue is resolved, create a Pull Request and close the issue.

## Coding Style 

1. Make sure to indent the code accordingly.
2. Avoid redundant code, create functions where possible.
3. Ensure all variables and functions have intuitive names.
4. Write comments where necessary so other developers understand the code and can pick up where you left off easily.
