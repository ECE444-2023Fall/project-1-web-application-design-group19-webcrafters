# Contributing to the Repo

Welcome to the GitHub Repo for Betula. We would love to hear your feedback! 
Here are the rules to contribute to our repo: 

1. Develop on a separate branch for each user story.
2. When completed and you have code that is functioning as it should, make a pull request.
3. Once pull request is approved, then merge your branch into the main branch and delete the separate branch.
4. If code is not completed and you need help with debugging / need further clarification, create a Git Issue and explain your progress so far and the issue in detail.

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## For Pull Requests 

Tag @AniqaT for pull requests of backend features, or @jessicawong3 for pull requests of frontend features. 
For @AniqaT or @jessicawong3, tag members of backend/frontend team accordingly.

## For Git Issues 

1. Include a detailed description of your progress so far, what is going wrong and the suspected cause. 
2. Link your branch with the Git Issue. 
3. Assign the issue to yourself and at least 1 other developer who can assist you.
4. Once the issue is resolved, create a Pull Request and close the issue.

## Coding Style 

1. Make sure to indent the code the appropriate amount depending on the file. Python files are indented four spaces, and html/css files are indented two.
2. Avoid redundant code, create functions where possible.
3. Ensure all variables and functions have intuitive names.
4. Write comments where necessary so other developers understand the code and can pick up where you left off easily.
